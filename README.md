## Machine Learning Project Structure

# Machine-Learning-CI-CD

This repository contains a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Machine Learning project. The CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the processes of testing, building, and deploying machine learning models, ensuring high code quality and fast iteration cycles. Additionally, Data Version Control (DVC) is integrated to manage and version datasets and machine learning models.

## Features

- **Automated Testing:** Runs unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness of the code.
- **Continuous Integration:** Automatically builds and tests the project on every commit.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Deploys the latest version of the project to the production environment after passing all tests.
- **Data Version Control:** Manages and versions datasets and machine learning models using DVC.
- **Scalability:** Easily scalable to handle larger datasets and more complex models.
- **Flexibility:** Supports various machine learning frameworks and libraries.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- DVC

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kanhaiya-gupta/Machine-Learning-CI-CD.git
   cd Machine-Learning-CI-CD
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install DVC:**
   ```bash
   pip install dvc
   ```

4. **Run the tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

### Usage

1. **Setting up DVC:**
   ```bash
   dvc init
   dvc remote add -d myremote /path/to/remote/store
   ```

2. **Tracking data with DVC:**
   ```bash
   dvc add data/my_dataset.csv
   git add data/my_dataset.csv.dvc .gitignore
   git commit -m "Track dataset with DVC"
   dvc push
   ```

3. **Training the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Evaluating the model:**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. **Deploying the model:**
   ```bash
   python deploy.py
   ```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions. The pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Linting:** Checks the code for formatting and style issues using `flake8`.
2. **Unit Tests:** Runs unit tests using `pytest`.
3. **Integration Tests:** Runs integration tests to ensure the end-to-end functionality.
4. **Build:** Builds the project using Docker.
5. **Deploy:** Deploys the project to the production environment.

The pipeline is triggered on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
